My name is Vladimir Zaigrajew and you may wonder who I am, well, I am recent graduate of Wroclaw University of Science and Technology in Poland, with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a master's in AI, I have a passion for Machine Learning and Computer Vision, with a particular interest in representation learning.

Throughout my academic journey, I have focused on exploring the field of Artificial Intelligence research, with a specific emphasis on Computer Vision and its real-world applications. As a result of my studies and research, I have gained a deep understanding of the fundamental concepts and principles of AI and am well-versed in the latest trends and technologies in the field.

My ultimate aim for this website is to showcase my research findings and contributions to the field of AI. I also want to encourage new people to fall in love with this field, **let`s destroy the humanity together üòà**.
### Education
- **Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology (WUST), Poland** (2021 ‚Äì 2022) <br /> Thesis Title: Contrastive learning for multi-label classification (accepted for NeurIPS 2022 Workshop). As a participant of AI Tech (government AI, ML and cybersecurity education project), I took part in the WACV 2022 and ICLR 2022 international conferences.
- **Bachelor of Science, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology (WUST), Poland** (2017 ‚Äì 2021) <br /> Major: Computer Science <br /> Minor: Applied Computer Engineering in Medicine <br /> Thesis Title: Human activity recognition on the basis of changes of WiFi characteristics.

### OpenAI [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), which writes blogs for me and solves my father's exams at university (well, not all).

What I asked: Machine learning funny jokes
```
Why was the machine learning model sad?

Because it was trained on a dataset of depression.
```
```
Why did the deep learning model break up with its girlfriend?

Because it realized it was in a neural network.
```
```
Why did the machine learning model get bad grades in school?

Because it was too busy training on the dataset of failing students.
```
```
Why was the deep learning model so good at solving crimes?

Because it was a real neural detective.
```

What I asked: Write to my professor an email asking where machine learning lecture will be tomorrow.

```
Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the location of tomorrow's machine learning lecture. 
I was unable to find the information on the course syllabus or online, and I wanted to confirm the location before the start of the class.

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
